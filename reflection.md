Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, and Null are examples of primitive data types in JavaScript.Each represents a distinct type of value, and building trustworthy code requires a grasp of their behavior.
Instead of creating complete solutions, I employed AI technologies to make difficult topics more understandable.Learning the distinction between null and undefined is one example.
One concept I want to explore further is type coercion, especially how implicit conversions can cause bugs
